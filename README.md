# simple-portfolio
This is a simple 4 tile portfolio where you can add in the link to your social media accounts. Made using HTML and CSS and open to anyone for use :)
In the HTML file, you'll find comments of where you can add in your hyperlinks. 
All the svg links are from iconpacks.net and you are free to change the social media svgs as per your preference.
I hope this helps non-coders have their own portfolio website. 
For this project, I focused on the color scheme and responsiveness.
